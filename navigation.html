									<h2>Navigation</h2>
									<p>The acoustics system calculates and then provides the navigation system with a
										predicted goal location of the ping pong ball or whatever else might be emitting sound waves.
										How does our robot get there?</p>
								</header>
								<p>A room inside any building in the real world would have obstacles, such as walls and furniture,
									which the robot would need to navigate around. A straight shot from start to finish isn’t possible.
									So, the robot runs through a path planning algorithm before it starts to move, and only then drives on
									that path from start to finish, sticking as close to the path as possible.</p>

														<h2>A Star Path Planning</h2>
													</header>
													<p>A variant of the A Star shortest paths algorithm is used to get the shortest path
														from the robot’s current location to the predicted sound source location given by
														the acoustics system. They're represented here by a green dot and an X respectively.</p>

														<h2>PID Actuation and Path Tracking</h2>
													</header>
													<p>A PID controller, parameterized by the translation and rotation errors between
														the robot's current state and goal state, is used to move the robot from its
													  current location to the sound source.</p>

									<p>The final path given by the A Star algorithm shown above is essentially a list of straight paths
											connected together by corner points. This list of corner points is what gets sent between the
											path finding and PID controller ROS nodes. For each corner point, the robot will use the PID
											controller to drive to it, and make a smooth transition between the previous straight shot and
											the next one. This is what gives the stop/start behavior seen in the video on the right. This
											sequential completion was made to be modular with the FSM; for example, splitting up the path
											into many smaller paths lessens the difficulty of implementing a basic obstacle detection.</p>

									<h3>Preloading the Map</h3>
								</header>
								<p>An assumption we had was that the base map (without extra obstacles) would be preloaded onto
										the robot before it begins its collection tasks. Under a lot of circumstances, however, this
										might not be the case, so dynamic path planning would be an ideal feature to add.</p>

								<header>
									<h3>Corner to Corner</h3>
								</header>
								<p>With our FSM, we had to trade smooth driving with modularity, however, this is something that
										could be easily fixed with a better driving control such as this one. Both the above and left gif
										can be found on this <a href="https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/PythonRobotics">PythonRobotics</a> repo.</p>

									<h3>A Star Tradeoffs</h3>
								</header>
								<p>Many optimizations were made for the A Star algorithm to work as quickly as it does, such as
										decreasing the resolution of the obstacle array (points which define the walls of the map).
										Above is the result of too much image resolution reduction. We had to find a nice balance
										between reducing the number of points A Star had to traverse over, and keeping the obstacles
										well defined.</p>
